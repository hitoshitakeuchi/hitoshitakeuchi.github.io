## Introduction

“GAN Paintings” (Oil on canvas, 2019)

I'm interested in how GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) can affect the transparency of photograph and the opacity of painting in the post-truth era.
I discover new motif that I have never seen. And latent spaces seem to be a good place to go on a search.
Theoretically latent spaces is only a collection of diverse vector space models.
But In the process of interpolation in latent spaces, there is a poetic and positive image with negative technical problems.

## Introduction

“Nomadic AI Agents” (Installation, 2018)

Nomadic AI Agents are practically useless AI agents.
The framework uses ML-Agents, a machine learning environment of Unity which is a game engine.
Through the learning Python script, the library TensorFlow for machine learning and the executable file created by Unity are linked to simulate,
learn the action of ball agent entering into the box while using obstacles in the scene,
it will start acting as if its will lived.
In a sense, being able to learn by machine learning is unexpectedly.

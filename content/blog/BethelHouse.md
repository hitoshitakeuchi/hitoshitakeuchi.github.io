## Introduction

"Bethel House" (Video Installation, 2013)

In 1978, several people with mental disorders, who had been discharged from Red Cross Hospital in Urakawa,
formed a survivors' group. They moved into an old, abandoned church house and started living together.
It was named "Bethel House" in 1984, and became the cornerstone of advocacy movement of people with mental disorders.

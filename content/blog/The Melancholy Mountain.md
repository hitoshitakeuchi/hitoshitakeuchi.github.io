## Introduction

＜“The Melancholy Mountain” (Video Installation, 2018)＞

The Melancholy Mountain is a multi display work by real time rendering.
This procedure mountain is drawn with a wireframe and not a landscape but gamescape.
We are only looking at the wireframe mesh deformed by the algorithm.
The landscape of a digital image today may be the landscape of simulated virtual images by code no longer what we think is landscape.

Dates: January 19, 2018 - January 20, January 12, 2018 - January 26

Location: SNARK, Fukushima Mural Vision

## Introduction

“The Melancholy Mountain” (Video Installation, 2018)

The Melancholy Mountain is a multi display work by real time rendering. This procedure mountain is drawn with a wireframe. This is not a landscape but gamescape.
We are only looking at the wireframe mesh deformed by the algorithm.
The landscape of a digital image today may be the landscape of simulated virtual images by code no longer what we think is landscape.But it may be one truth.

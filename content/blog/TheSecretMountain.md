## Introduction

“The Secret Mountain” (Video Installation, 2018)

The Secret Mountain is a multi display work and also VR work.
This typical mountain object is indeed an unwavering entity capable of reviewing poetry and is a poet with a unique personality.
The viewer looks at the landscape that changes in real time along with poetry and at the same time is involved with objects containing various contexts,
meanings, images that are rolling in chaos while wandering through the terrain world, We will read the environment and algorithm of.
Moreover, by trying as an exhibition, by connecting the media that can make the reality and the virtual space conscious,
the interface of the environment including various others who could not be seen by VR works alone will emerge.
I believe that the mountain has a certain personality.

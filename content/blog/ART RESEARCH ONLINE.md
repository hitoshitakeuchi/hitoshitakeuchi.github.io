## Introduction

＜ART RESEARCH ONLINE (Research Project, 2020)＞

With the expansion of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), exhibitions and other events have been cancelled or postponed,
and I am planning an online research project that relates to art for personal space.
It's a project where people from various fields can introduce their papers, read books, and present their works.

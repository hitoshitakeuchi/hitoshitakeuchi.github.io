## Introduction

＜“GAN Paintings” (Oil on canvas, 2019)＞

I’m interested in how GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) can affect the transparency of photograph and the opacity of painting in the post-truth era. I discover new motif that I have never seen. And latent spaces seem to be a good place to go on a search. Theoretically latent spaces is only a collection of diverse vector space models, but in the process of interpolation in latent spaces, there is a poetic image with technical problems.I accept positively the existence of persons and things expressed in the image.

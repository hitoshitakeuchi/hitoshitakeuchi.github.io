      <description>Introduction ＜ART RESEARCH ONLINE (Research Project, 2020)＞
With the expansion of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), exhibitions and other events have been cancelled or postponed, and I am planning an online research project that relates to art for personal space. It&amp;rsquo;s a project where people from various fields can introduce their papers, read books, and present their works.

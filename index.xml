      <description>Introduction ＜ART RESEARCH ONLINE (Research Project, 2020)＞
With the expansion of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), exhibitions and other events have been cancelled or postponed, and I am planning an online research project that relates to art for personal space. It&amp;rsquo;s a project where people from various fields can introduce their papers, read books, and present their works.

      <description>Media Artist
Born 1985 in Tokyo, Japan. Bachelor of Intermedia Art, Tokyo University of the Arts. I’m mostly interested in human perception and media aesthetics theory. By making media and computational art works, exploring new realism. In addition, I’m researching the relationship between landscape and new media. And I’m inspired by our capacity to dig deeper and learn more about the poetry of landscape.
